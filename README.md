# Rod Logic

## XOR Gate

The housing is made of cubic diamond with orthogonal (100) surfaces. The rods are made of lonsdaleite. The lattice constant of the rods misaligns with the housing, providing more flexibility to fine-tune the vdW potential. However, knobs must be placed irregularly. Their separations aren't evenly divisible by the cubic diamond lattice constant.

The structure was energy-minimized to allow (100) surfaces to render with the reconstructed geometry. The structure remained stable after 48 ps of MD simulation, with temperature from leftover vdW energy that the minimizer didn't eliminate (last image).
